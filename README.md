# ScoutoliersBackend-2018
This is the backend server to a scouting web app made for FIRST Power Up 2018.
We are The Gongoliers, FRC Team 5112.  We are based in North Scituate, Rhode Island at Ponaganset High School.
Developed by Nicholas Bottone, with special thanks to Joseph Mazzone and Kyle Corry.

## What is the FIRST Robotics Competition?
The FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition (or FRC) is an event where high school-aged teams compete head to head on a special playing field with robots they have designed, built, and programmed.

## What is the Scoutoliers app?
The Scoutoliers app allows dedicated competition scouters to observe and efficiently record data.  Scouters may use portable laptop computers, mobile tablets, Android devices, and iOS devices.  The Scoutoliers app allows scouters to go through the pits and ask other teams questions about their robots to create a database full of useful information.  During the matches, scouters will also watch matches and record the performance of each robot on the field to understand each team's real-world abilities and usefulness.  All this data will be processed and turned into ranked statistics which can be quickly read and understood.  This data can be used to inform the driveteam about their opponents' and teammates' abilities before a match, it can be used to gauge and rank robot performance, and it can be used to select the best teams based on point-scoring ability.  This information is especially important when drafting alliances for the playoffs, as you can see which teams would benefit your alliance the most.

## What does this backend server do?
This Java-powered backend server allows a web client to connect to a mainframe computer, save collected scouting data from FRC matches, and calculate scores and rankings for the local competition.

## Can my team use it?
Sure!  If you understand the code, you are free to adapt it to your team's needs.  This code is licensed under the MIT License, so you must provide attribution to Nicholas Bottone and The Gongoliers when using any piece of it in your work.  In the future, we plan on creating a shared backend server so other teams can use The Scoutoliers App without typing a single line of code!  We'll keep you updated on the status of this.
